# Constrain BNS parameters with GRBs and estimate joint detection rate (GRB-GW)

Estimate Binary Neutron Star (BNS) parameters with BILBY package (https://github.com/lscsoft/bilby) using observational information (d_L, z, RA, Dec) from Non-Collapsar Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). The repository contains also scripts in which the GWFish package (https://github.com/janosch314/GWFish) is used to estimate the possible joint detection rate between the GRBs afterglow, of the best Multi-Messenger (MM) candidate of my analysis, and the associated GW signals as detected by Einstein Telescope (ET).
