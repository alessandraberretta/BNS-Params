# Predictions on joint detection rates (GRB-GW)

Estimation of joint detection rates between Non-Collapsar Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and simulated associated Gravitational Wave (GW) signals produced in the coalescence of two Neutron Stars (NSs). The GWFISH package (https://github.com/janosch314/GWFish) is used to estimate the detectability of the simulated GW signals.
